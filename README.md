This repository demonstrates a common error involving unsafe raw pointers and vector manipulation in Rust. The `bug.rs` file contains code that exhibits undefined behavior due to violating memory safety rules. The `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates a safe solution using Rust's built-in methods, avoiding raw pointers.
